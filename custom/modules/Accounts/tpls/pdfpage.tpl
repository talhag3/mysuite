<h4>Dear Dr. DEBRA GOETTSCH:</h4>
<br>
<p>
Recently we have sent one or more prescriptions for your consideration to prescribe a therapeutic alternative for your
patient, 2e9 402dc, who is an employee of Client Name.
</p>
<br>
<p>
We are employed by Client Name to help reduce their health care costs by offering their employees a lower cost
medication alternative.
</p>
<br>
<p>
We understand the challenges of providing your patient with the right drug for the right price. <b>Our top priority is maintaining safety and efficacy, while minimizing side effects and drug interactions.</b> We know times are tough and our program looks to provide cost-savings to both patients and sponsoring companies in order for their plan to continue to be able to provide benefits to your patients.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Any approved changes are always communicated to the patient first. This allows for the patient's input before any changes are made.</b> The pharmacy savings program is committed to helping all employees minimize out-of-pocket costs <b>without compromising their quality of care.</b></p>
<br>
<p>
This is an innovative program which analyzes prescription drugs and communicates with patients and their physicians on quality of care and cost-saving opportunities. If you have any questions regarding this program or would like further information on the alternative medication we are recommending, please contact us at 1-855-675-3329.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Once again, for the benefit of Client Name and your patients we would like you to seriously consider these alternatives.
</p>
<br>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<br>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Your Pharmacy Team</p>
